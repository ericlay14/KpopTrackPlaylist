Solo Project Brief


1. Identify your user(s)
Myself and maybe other Korean-pop music fans
2. What is the problem youâ€™re solving?
Not necessarily a problem, a way of finding out if I can get songs and music videos of an artist showing at the same time
3. What is the solution?
Making a card that would have all of my favorite artists information, favorite tracks of the group and a clip of the music video
4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
Set up a database to have the information that I need for each artist. 
To set up a container to hold each artist's information.
Use react/html to properly make it appear on the localhost
5. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
Setting up a database because the database unit really confused me, probably will do more research on how to get a proper database setup
Finding a way to get my information besides coding into a database, maybe find an api for this
The use of music and music videos will be hard to implement
6. What are the stretch goals?
To have a on-click feature to hide and show cards
Add a favorite button to show which cards I like the best
